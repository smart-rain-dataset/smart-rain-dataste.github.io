Hi, Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. graduate from the National University of Singapore. During my Ph.D. research, I focused on sensor degradation in rainy weather and conducted my research at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) Future Mobility Group. Sensor degradation is one of the major challenges that negatively influences the safety and performance of autonomous driving systems. To address this problem, we published three research works to quantify LiDAR sensor degradation and released two datasets to encourage community collaborative efforts to investigate this problem. With sensor degradation information, autonomous driving systems can increase awareness of weather changes and sensor performance deterioration and take corresponding actions to reduce the risk.
